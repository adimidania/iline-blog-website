# About this repository

This was supposed to be a blog, It was among the very first projects using HTML and CSS, I remember giving up on it because I didn't know how I can allow my friend to put her writings and audios in the website, and It felt so hard to achieve back then. I'll keep it here because It reminds me of great things.
