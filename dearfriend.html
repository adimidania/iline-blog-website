        <h1>Dear friend</h1>
        <p>
            They said It's too short cover it, no It's too long cut it. They said It's too loud shut it, then why are
            you so quiet ? why is it all black ? use some colors! no, no! not like that It's too colorful. <br>
            Nowadays, we've been living in a place where being a judgmental person became a lifestyle, where being rude
            is for your own good, where my opinion on you matters more than your own self. They judge you for the way
            talk, the way you wear, and even for the way you laugh and express yourself. Why do you cat like that ? Why
            won't you sit with us anymore? why are you so boring after being the loudest person ? - they said. <br>
            Have anyone of you thought or stopped for a second to consider how heavy your words int their ears, or how 
            touchable It is in their hearts. It was easy for you to throw it in their face right ? It took seconds from 
            you to say it, doesn't it ? so what if all your non-sense will take them years to recover from, and what if 
            they couldn't ? <br>
            I hope the moment you read this, you'd think about it for a while etc.
